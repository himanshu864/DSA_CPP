/*

C++ was original called *C with classes* : to improve reading and maintainablity
C - procedural oriented programming (POP) - not efficient and data secure
Procedural - main focus on instructions/functions, not on flow of data

In POP, function uses local/global data and data moves openly from fn to fn

OOPS:
 - works on concept of class / objects
 - class is template to create object
 - treats data as critial element
 - decomposes problem in objects and builds data/functino around them

Classes:
 - Basic template for creating objects; eg - "Animal"
 - User defined data types / structures

Objects:
 - Basic runtime entities. eg - dogs, cats, etc

Encapsulation:
 - Wrapping data and functions into single unit

Data Abstraction:
 - Displaying only essential information while concealing underlying details

Inheritances:
 - Properties of one class can be inherited into others
 - Resuablity

Polymorphism:
 - Ability to take multiple forms
 - Eg: function overloading

Dynamic Binding:
 - Code which will execute is not know until program runs (runtime)

Message Passing:
 - Object.message (information)
 - communication b/w objects

## Benifits of OOPS:
 - Reusability
 - Data security
 - Multiple objects co-exist, without any interference
 - Software Complexity is more managable
