## Inheritance:

- Reusablity - to follow DRY principle : Don't Repeat Yourself
- We can reuse a class and add Additional features to it
- Reusing already tested and debugged class saves time, money and effort

## What is Inheritance:

- Brings concept of Reusability in c++
- can reuse properties of an existing class by inheriting it
- the existing class is called BASE class
- the new class inherited is called DERIVED class

## Types of inheritance:

- Single
- Multiple
- Multilevel
- Hybrid

## Single Inheritance:

- Derived class with only one Base class
  - eg : Employee derives Programmer : `A --> B`
- B Extends work of A class

## Multiple Inheritance:

- A class with Derived from more than one Base class
  - eg : Programmer(C) acts as an Employee(A) as well as Assistant(B) for technical stuff
- C inherits all properties of A and B : `A --> C <-- B`

## Hierarchical Inheritance:

- Several classes Derived from one Base class
  - eg : A programmer(B) and A manager(C) are both essentially employees(A) of a company
- Both B and C are derived from A : `B <-- A --> C`

## Multilevel Inheritance:

- deriving a class from an already derived class
  - Eg : Mammals(B) are animals(A) with more, and humans(C) are mammals with more
- B is derived from A, and C is derived from B : `A --> B --> C`

## Hybrid Inheritance:

- Combination of Single, Multiple, Hierarchical and Multilevel inherihence
  - Eg : Animal(A) derives Mammals(B) and Birds(C), which Bat(D) is derived from both Mammals and Birds

```
      A
     / \
    B   C
     \ /
      D
```

- A derives B and C (heirarchical); B and C derive D (Multiple); A derive B which derive C (Multilevel); D is derived from A(Single)
